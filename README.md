## Questions to be Answered with Analysis
1. Do regions of the world determine how well athletes will do per sport?
2. Does Population increase sport success rate?
3. Does number of athletes correlate to medal wins overall/per sport?
4. Are certain countries more likely to win more medals? Specificlly gold medals? 
5. How many times has a sport or event been included in the games? (summer or winter)
6. Has there been a change in BMI or Avg Height and Weight of athletes throughout the years?
   - No, between 1911 to 2010 the average height stayed between 172 to 177 with the lowest being with athletes born in 2000.
8. Are athletes born in specific months/years more likely to win Gold, Silver, Bronze?
9. Are there any similarities between the gold medal winners? 

## Tools/Libraries Being Used For Data Cleaning/Analysis
Python - Machine Learning to accurately predict medal winners for 2024. Along with some data cleansing 

Pandas - Data Cleaning and some Visualizations. 

Tableau - Visualizations of Data. Creating Stories to explain visuals along with thoughts and ideas behind them.
